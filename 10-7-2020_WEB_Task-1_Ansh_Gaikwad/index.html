            <p>
                I am a beginner developer with 2+ years of programming experience. 
                I know I am a newbie but trust me I have a lot of potential than anyone expects of me. 
                I like participating in competitive coding competitions and love playing brain teaser games, mostly chess. 
                I like developing interesting applications with python and android studio. 
                My other fields of interest are machine learning and data analytics. 
                I am also a cyber security enthusiast and have completed multiple ethical hacking courses. 
                Well to explain myself in short is that I am a first year student who is exploring all the fields and finding what best suites me.
